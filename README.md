# PNR-using-FD-Filter
This project simulates periodic noise on an image, analyzes its frequency components using FFT, designs and applies a Notch Reject Filter to suppress specific frequencies, and then reconstructs the image via Inverse FFT, effectively reducing periodic noise while preserving overall image quality.
